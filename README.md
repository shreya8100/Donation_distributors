# Donation_distributors
  We wish create a program that would maintain records of continuous donors and donations which one needed will be used to immediately aid natural disaster victims and honour the donors having a generous amount of donations by searching and sorting the file in descending order.
  To execute this data will be collected from various sources such as geological surveys and social media. This data will be analysed to increase efficiency of the program.
  This is being done to ensure that a standby source of relief money is always there should any natural calamity ever occur. In this way there will never be any delay in providing supplements and many lives will be saved. The basic aim is to maintain a constant reserve of money that can be used at any time.
